# T-001 – Project Initialization

## Goal

Initialize the Pinus Maximus project with a clean, scalable foundation
following the defined architecture and privacy-first principles.

## Why

A well-structured starting point ensures:
- consistent architecture from day one
- easier testing and refactoring
- maintainable growth
- no technical debt introduced early

## Scope

This task covers the technical setup only.
No user-facing features are implemented in this step.

- [X] Initialize WXT project
- [ ] Configure TypeScript (strict mode enabled)
- [ ] Set up project folder structure (domain / infra / ui / shared)

- [ ] Set up Vitest with coverage
- [ ] Create `tests/unit` base structure
- [ ] Add minimal Playwright setup (empty smoke test)
- [ ] Create initial `docs/` structure
- [X] Add Apache 2.0 license
- [X] Add initial README

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Project builds successfully
- [ ] Dev server runs without errors
- [ ] Unit tests run successfully
- [ ] Coverage report generates
- [ ] E2E runner starts without configuration errors
- [ ] No TypeScript errors
- [ ] No ESLint errors
- [ ] Repository structure matches architecture document

## Notes

This task establishes the long-term technical foundation of the project.
All future development must follow the defined architecture boundaries.
